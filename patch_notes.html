        <li>New client patch: v43</li>
        <li>There is now a new feature that lets you track attunable items in your current zone. It's disabled by default but can be enabled in Interface -> Addons -> Item Tracker.</li>
        <li>Attunable items list now lets dual class characters select to filter for one of the classes.</li>
        <li>Maybe fixed bug where some dual class combinations could not parry despite having the parry skill.</li>
